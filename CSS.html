    <h1>HAPPY WITH YOU</h1>

    <p>A Hare was very popular with the other animals in the jungle who all claimed to be her friends. One day she heard the hounds approaching her and hoped to escape them by the aid of her friends. So, she went to the horse, and asked him to carry her away from the hounds on his back.
    But he declined, stating that he had important work to do for his master.
    “He felt sure,” he said, “that all her other friends would come to her assistance.”</p>
